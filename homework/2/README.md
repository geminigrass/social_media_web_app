I choose POST to translate the data between server and client. Reasons are below:
(1)If I use GET then the data can be displayed at the URL and users are able to change the input just right at the URL 
(2)POST is safer than GET because parameters are not saved in browser history.

When malformed action performed, the screen shows "NaN",which stands for not a number to alert that.
