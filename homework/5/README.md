I use python3.
(1)As stated in HW4,Profile picture won't show in Global/Follower Stream to urge users to upload one.
(2)Grumblr will refresh both post and comment in Global,Follower Stream,Profile page every 5s.
(3)If the user profile image, only the comment/post made after  that change will be consistent with
the new image, the old comment/post are consistent with the old image. This is because the image
can also be treated as a history.
(4)To submit a common, you just need to click the button.
I didn't do the work to clear the input box after you submit your comment so becareful
with that.
