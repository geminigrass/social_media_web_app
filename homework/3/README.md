1.Once the user signed in/signed up,they will be redirect to the home page to see whether they are logged in. So I don't use "next" to retrive the page.

2.I assume unlogged in user can only register/login. So if unlogged in user click the "global steam"/"prifile"/"new a post"/"log out" they will remain at the home page that reminds them to sign in.
