### Committing your work (10/10)

### Specification fulfillment (30/30)

### Validation (20/20)

### Routing and configuration (10/10)

-0, We recommend that you modularize your Django projects by using an application-specific urls.py files in each application directory, and use your project-wide urls.py file to include each application's routes. See the Shared To-do List demo application for an example of this.  

### General requirements, appropriate use of technologies (30/30)

-0, Helper functions are usually stored in a different python file than views.py (which usually consists of only views).

### Additional Information

-0, In your justification for using POST instead of GET, you mentioned that POST is safe. In reality, POST requests can be easily manipulated and offer no real security.
